# Addition
addition = 5 + 3
print("Addition: 5 + 3 =", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = 5 - 3
print("Subtraction: 5 - 3 =", subtraction)

# Multiplication
multiplication = 5 * 3
print("Multiplication: 5 * 3 =", multiplication)

# Division
division = 5 / 3
print("Division: 5 / 3 =", division)

# Modulus (Remainder)
modulus = 5 % 3
print("Modulus: 5 % 3 =", modulus)

# Exponentiation (Power)
exponentiation = 5**3
print("Exponentiation: 5 ** 3 =", exponentiation)

# Floor Division
floor_division = 5 // 3
print("Floor Division: 5 // 3 =", floor_division)
